description: |
    This hands-on workshop introduces Kubernetes deployment and
    orchestration from the ground up. Working in small groups, you will
    build lightweight Kubernetes clusters using Raspberry Pi hardware,
    progressing from initial cluster setup to deploying containerised
    applications and establishing cross-cluster communication.
    
    We will cover essential Kubernetes concepts and practical skills
    including cluster initialisation, pod management, deployments and
    basic observability. No prior Kubernetes experience is required,
    though familiarity with containers (Docker), SSH, and the Unix shell
    will be helpful. Participants will need to bring their own laptops to
    interact with the clusters.
    
    Target audience: Anyone interested in setting up a Kubernetes cluste on
    their own infrastructure, or getting experience interacting with such systems
    and container orchestration. This workshop is delivered by the Cloud-Native SIG
    team with support from the Computational Abilities Knowledge Exchange Network+.
