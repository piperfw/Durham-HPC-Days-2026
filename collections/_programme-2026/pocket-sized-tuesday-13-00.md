description: "This hands-on workshop introduces Kubernetes deployment and
orchestration from the ground up. Working in small groups, you will
build lightweight Kubernetes clusters using Raspberry Pi hardware,
progressing from initial cluster setup to deploying containerised
applications and establishing cross-cluster communication.

We will cover essential Kubernetes concepts and practical skills
including cluster initialisation, pod management, deployments and
basic observability. No prior Kubernetes experience is required,
though familiarity with containers (Docker), SSH, and the Unix shell
will be helpful. Participants will need to bring their own laptops to
interact with the clusters.

Target audience: Anyone interested in setting up a Kubernetes cluster
on their own infrastructure, or getting experience interacting with
such systems and container orchestration. [This workshop is delivered
by the Cloud-Native SIG team and CAKE fellowship support]"
